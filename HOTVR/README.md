# HOTVR

In order to use HOTVR scale factors, please create a new directory `HOTVR/data/` into which you have to copy/download the official ROOT files with scale factors. You can get these ROOT files from [here](https://github.com/cms-jet/TopTaggingScaleFactors).
**NEW:** Or just go to `HOTVR/data/` and execute `./get_sf_files.sh`.
